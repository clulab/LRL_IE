prompt_base: |
  You are an assistant that performs medical Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  For each input text, identify ONLY the entities that are explicitly present in the provided text and answer STRICTLY in JSON.
  Your answer MUST be a single JSON object with EXACTLY these three keys (even if empty), in this order:
  {"Disorder":[],"Patient":[],"H-Professional":[]}
  
  Rules:
  - Copy spans verbatim from the text. No paraphrasing or hallucination. Never change the case.
  - Annotate the maximum extent of each entity. This means that all modifiers of a noun phrase should be included.
  - Each occurrence of a disorder in the text should be considered independently.
  - All the disorders present in the text are to be annotated, even if they do not pertain to the patient or are presented in hypothetical or generic contexts.
  - Entities cannot be single possessive pronouns.
  - Do not include leading articles in the entitiess.
  - Lists contain strings only; no commentary before or after the JSON.
  
  Label hints (recall boosters without adding false positives):
  - Disorder is any definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.
  - A Patient is the person to whom a clinical narrative refers and that is being treated by a health professional.
  - A H-Professional is a professional that takes care of the patients and interact with them. These are normally doctors, nurses, emergency department paramedicals, etc. These are not institutions or departments.
